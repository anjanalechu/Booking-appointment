# Appointment Booking System

This is a simple appointment booking system built with Node.js (backend) and plain JavaScript (frontend). Users can view available time slots and book appointments in 30-minute intervals.

bash
cd backend
node server.js


The server will start at: http://localhost:3000

### 4. Start the frontend

### 5. Ready to use!

You can now book appointments via the UI.
